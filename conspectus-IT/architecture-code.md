# Architecture: code

## One Big Fluke › What is "founder code"?

This is code that's in your codebase that was written by a cofounder of the project. The purpose of founder code is to demonstrate the intended outcome of design choices. It goes beyond a requirements or design document because it's exactly specific about how the software is supposed to work.

Founder code is great for illustrating an important architectural choice (e.g., how to make a system scalable).

Founder code is especially helpful in UX design. Complex animations, transitions, and interactions can be hard to describe. Data visualizations take a long time to play with before you discover the right combination that's compelling.

Founder code is fundamentally just another name for prototyping. When a team has grown to the point where other (better) programmers have time to rewrite the original founder code, that's success.

Thus, the ultimate goal of founder code is to become obsolete.
