## :robot_face: Exploratory testing - talking with DeepSeek 2025.04.25

Exploratory testing is a type of software testing where the tester actively explores the application without following a strict script.

Exploratory testing is often mentioned alongside agile methodologies because it's flexible. It relies on the tester's creativity and intuition. The tester might use their experience to guess where bugs could be, especially in areas that scripted tests might not cover.

Automated tests handle regression and basic functionality, while exploratory testing addresses complex scenarios and usability issues. It's complementary.

In scripted testing, you might have automated tests, but exploratory is manual. However, there might be tools to assist, like note-taking apps or screen capture software to document findings. Some sources mention session-based testing, where testers allocate a specific time (a session) to explore a particular area, then report their findings. Session management tools: TestRail, qTest.

Since it's unstructured, it's hard to measure coverage. How do you ensure that all parts of the application are tested? Maybe through charters or missions that guide the tester's exploration. Also, documentation is important; even though it's exploratory, testers need to record their process and findings for reproducibility and accountability.
