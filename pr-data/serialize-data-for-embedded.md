# Serialize data for embedded

- 2024

- I don't like the rigidness of plain C `struct`. You add one field and deserialization of existing savegame file is broken.

- :speaking_head_in_silhouette: I want to store not `{ value1, value2, value3 }` but `{ key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3  }` (types of values can be arbitrary, they must be handled manually on deserialization) / [d9k](https://discord.com/channels/768759024270704641/831589248239009832/1309704497001529464)

## Serialize c++ structures

### :black_square_button: C++ 11 serializer

- [c-plus-plus-serializer](https://github.com/goblinhack/c-plus-plus-serializer?tab=readme-ov-file#user-defined-class-serialization) by [goblinhack](https://github.com/goblinhack)
	- _A minimal C++11 header only serializer. Can serialize basic types, strings, containers, maps and custom classes. No suppprt yet for pointer types._
	- [ ] I have simple probably genius idea: https://github.com/goblinhack/c-plus-plus-serializer + [custom class](https://github.com/goblinhack/c-plus-plus-serializer?tab=readme-ov-file#user-defined-class-serialization) with fields `std::map<string, int> ints`, `std::map<string, strings> strings` etc for each data type required by the game
		- [ ] Also  game version will be saved to `strings.version`  to apply migrations to savegame data.
		- [ ] Also `#define`s can be used to balance code readability, savegame binary readability and savegame size, for example `#define INTS_KEY_HEALTH 'h'`
	- :sparkles: Will work fast: native C++ with minimal overhead
	- :microbe: Just bit representation one-after-another, no keys, comments or markers to see which data piece is what.
	- :microbe: not portable
	- :sparkles: not widespread

- New type must be declared at :open_file_folder: `src/mpack/Writer.cpp`
- smth. like Redux store

- :speaking_head_in_silhouette: [How to remove single item from Dictionary? | issue #10 | palimpsest](https://github.com/stephane-caron/palimpsest/issues/10)
	- Seems to be fixed at [TRUEPIC/cborg](https://github.com/TRUEPIC/cborg):
- serialize vector?
- [ ] need to cut out Eigen support
- [ ] need to add for every new type code in `include/palimpsest/{json,pack}/riter.h`
