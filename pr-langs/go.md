		- BFF - В этой схеме основную нагрузку несёт система управления базой данных (СУБД). Скорость приёма запросов незначительно влияет на результат и зависит от архитектуры веб сервера
		- Node: код короче, dev-режим запуска, максимально удобная работа с JSON, не нужно "прокидывать" ошибки по всей цепочке функций
		- Golang: бинарный Protobuf удобнее

## Why is Go's Garbage Collection so criticized? : r/golang

- https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/z1o2oe/why_is_gos_garbage_collection_so_criticized/?rdt=56407

Takn0711:

_IMHO it's because of the weird place Go is in._

_If you have a low level language, such as C/C++, you want to control everything that's happening, and avoid the overhead of carbage collection: since you are in control of everything, you are supposed to know when to free memory, no need for someone else to scan your memory._

_If you have a high level language, like Python, JS, and Java to a certain extend (I do consider Java as medium-high level), you already have performance overhead by definition, because of the VM/interpreter, so you don't mind having a bit more to delegate the memory handling to someone else and make your code simpler._
