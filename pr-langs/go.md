	- :microbe: Symbols starting with an uppercase letter are automatically public and the rest are private. In most other languages, type names, by convention, begin with an uppercase letter, and variable names begin with a lowercase one. This convention means that variables can never shadow types.

		- :microbe: _Google has a toxic relationship with the open source community. Google spent YEARS just closing pull requests, discussions, and ideas about generics in Golang. They just change their mind on a whim and refuse to invite discussions simply because something doesn't fit their exact individual decision despite community support._
