Go - trash language which does everything done so quickly.

JS: `parseInt(0.00000005) // 5`

Once you exceed certain size of project TypeScript can be very annoying.

Java security failed?

Primeagen doesn't trust Tiobe index.

`mut` came from Rust. Hard to reverse engineer. Malware dev say thanks.

Everyone wants the speed of C but no one wants to use C.

Primeagen thinks Rust suffers from too many features as C well as C++.

C++ example: const pointer to a constant
TypeScript: `{} as const`.

## Picking A Language In 2025 | ThePrimeTime

Rust: I love you can do it. I don't want to do it.

Go isn't great language. It have lots footguns but it's extremely productive language and you can build a lots of stuff with it.

Wants to become good at macros. Elixir have good macro system.

Zig - compile time macros.

Guest: If you learn new language without senior guidance you will stumble upon mid-level solutions. So your assumptions about language may be incorrect.

Guest: not greate time to learn language because active development and you don't really know where these languages are going. I would wait 5 years more for fresh languages to develop.

C++ like a racecar without doors or seatbelts / julia_x86.

Primeagen rule of thumb: try to read standart library. I cannot understand C++ std. What and why it's happening.

Primeagen: As a content creator I plan to try a language and in the end explain how I feel.


Guest: it's best to pick language from use case. It may happen you need to rewrite http layer for picked immature language.

Odin programming language. [example games]

Primeagen: I always enjoyed writing C. As easy it was writing C also it sometimes turned out you know nothing and was extremely difficult.

Guest: Odin language. They don't oversell.

Guest: I would want a language that is based on vectors.

Primeagen: If I would choose FP language it probably be OCaml because of it's Rust-like type system. It has GC but you can declare function so it works on stack.

Guest: it's possible that Jai's metaprogramming can help me to build vector language.

Learned Elixir during Advent of code.

Don't worry about using language in future, even year from now.

Worry about writing code only.

Writing bad code more often probably would save a lot of time.\[ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤¨\]
