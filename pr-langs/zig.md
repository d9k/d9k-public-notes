## Zig Language | Thoughts After 2 Years | codingjerk, 2025

Zig obvious fine control examples.
Robust explicitness.
Friendly community of professionals.

2016

No hidden memory allocations.
Obvious allocators.

comptime - code runs on compile time instead of runtime

defer - automatically run when going out of scope

no exception. function must return error value.

Supports c/c++ cross-compilation with LLVM.

## Go is blazingly faster than Zig? | ThePrimeagen

Zig is prerry fun lang to work with but was encumbered by segfaults.

Store requests in queque not older then 10 seconds.

JS on Bun - 1 hour.

	- 25:29 Ghostty developer: When reads & writes Rust just not having fun.
	- He didn't like jumping back and forth implementing traits with Rust.
	- PrimeAgen: no interfaces in Zig confused me.
		- Mitchell: At first tried to watch every Zig talk about using dynamic dispatch and vtables instead of interfaces. Then realised you don't always need an interface. Then realized Zig comptime makes static dispatch similar to interfaces possible.
	- Doesn't want to return to Go, even PHP seems more interesting. But loves Go community.
		- 3rd person: I don't get the same feelings of Joy when writing Go like I do with other languages. But it's good for working with other people!
	- Go was not a choise because wanted to own every single allocation.
	- Talks with Zig author. Excellent community.

- :tv: [Why does everyone hate Go? | YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVb65xABTWw)
	- 1:00 Zig creator criticizes Go.
	- 2 types of language users:
		- Doesn't care: just ship, `$$$`, want users
		- Programming purist: Associates their self worth with the language. Hyper-fixates on complex programming solutions. "Above" the simpletons

	- Interoperability with C: Zig can use C libraries. Incremental adoption
	- 2:00 Errors are part of type system. Managing errors is required
	- 3:20 Rust tries to eliminate errors by design. Rust tracks variables lifetime.
	- 4:00 Comptime instead separate C macro language
	- 4:50 Cross-compilation. Toolchain is a part of the language. Integrated TDD
	- 5:10 Zig concurrency is a native language feature
	- 6:10 [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) ad (algo tasks and test assignments tasks (like build own SQLite))
