## Why is Smalltalk not popular? : r/smalltalk

interactive coding experience. It's a real eye-opener.

I'm no expert but Smalltalk systems used to be very proprietary and expensive. So people choose free Java instead. I think it's that simple.

The idea of shipping the live image with all the code inside it offended management, when alternatives like Java meant distributing something compiled that was open for extension but not examination. -- And yet here we are, shipping containers to servers. Essentially an image on top of a complex framework -- Everything old is new again! :)

There is Squeak and Pharo, at squeak.org and pharo.org. There is also text-based GNU Smalltalk. My struggle with Pharo(and likely other Smalltalks) is finding the right objects and methods. Obviously, there is a lot of sample code, but I find reverse engineering the classes a big time sucker.

Smalltalk was already losing to C++ when Java arrived. Smalltalk was expensive to buy developer licenses for, slow in production, and the Smalltalk vendors put all their attention into competing against each other. Smalltalk failed for mostly social and economic reasons.

Smalltalk has never been popular with the academy. It came out of an industrial research program. Smalltalk in fact has had robust support for collaborating teams, continuous integration, distributed data stores, and deployment to multi-machine environments for scale and resilience long before anyone dreamed up “web” “applications” in the “cloud”.
