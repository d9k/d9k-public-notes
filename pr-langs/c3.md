	- _Compiler for the C3 language_
	- Thanks to full ABI compatibility with C, it's possible to mix C and C3 in the same project with no effort. As a demonstration, vkQuake was compiled with a small portion of the code converted to C3 and compiled with the c3c compiler. (The aging fork can be found at https://github.com/c3lang/vkQuake)
	- C3 owes its inspiration to the C2 language: to iterate on top of C without trying to be a whole new language.
