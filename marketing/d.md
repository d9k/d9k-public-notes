I do my part! ☝️ I am using D for data processing as part of my Bachelor's thesis /BinaryToDecimal

I think it's prime time for adoption was 10 years ago, and at the time D was suffering from schizophrenia by having two standard libraries, and that turned everyone away. / Poddster

The popular languages are the ones who were there when people needed them and there wasn't a big enough need for D. 1. There is no canonical way to write D code. It's more of a language for mature developers who already know what they want to achieve and just use D to get there. 2. The libraries are not very mature. 3. It's going to be quite difficult to find people to develop and maintain the code.  / IanisVasilev
