Why more camps on game console releases?

Facetime was cool simple technology everyone loved.

Homogenization. All social media apps steal features from each other. Smartphones & cars copy style from iPhone & Tesla.

Annoying in the "rash-kind of".

Too integrated in our everyday life's. (Please scan QR code to install app to buy tickets...)
