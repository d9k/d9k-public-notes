# Marketing: NodeJS

- puninspiring: Nodejs is good for bootstrapping a full stack application rather quickly and with a good tooling ecosystem.
	- But it is single threaded (if it matters) and not efficient in heavy calculations or under high concurrency.
	- What has actually reduced is the number of startups trying to build a MVP and fish for funding. These startups were hiring aggressively which kept up the demand for nodejs full stack / backend devs.
	- Coding bootcamps and low tier engineering colleges are pumping out more supply of nodejs devs with low skill and even lower salary expectations, saturating the market.
	- Sad to say but if you are only skilled in the nodejs ecosystem, it's a tough market to find yourself in. Unless you are like top 1-5% in terms of skill.
