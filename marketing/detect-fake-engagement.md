Fake engagement will often have a few tells that make it stand out:

- The users starring will be created recently - since they often get banned.
- They won't act in the same way an ordinary user does - actually contributing to code in our case.
- The engagement will be "delivered" in large bursts - getting hundreds of engagements on day X but gaining zero engagements on days X⁻¹ and X⁺¹.

When checking the star history using [OSS Insight](https://ossinsight.io/) we see that the repository went from 0 to 99 stars on February 25th. That is a lot of stars to gain in a single day.

For comparison prettier, maybe the most used formatter, gains around 10 stars a day.

A quick look revealed that every single user was created within the last few weeks - suspicious 🤔
